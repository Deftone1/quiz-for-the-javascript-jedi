# quiz-for-the-javascript-jedi
Multiple choice timed quiz on Javascript-related fundamentals!

This project was very difficult to execute, and took many many hours of review, note-taking, and tutorials to try and figure out how to go about it.

Unfortunately, I was unable to fully execute app along with specified criteria in the time alloted.  Below please find a list of specifications that I was successful and, also, unsuccessful in. 

Successful: 

- App deploys
- App presents quiz header, short introduction, and 'start quiz' button
- Start button can successfully be engaged
- Start button initiates timer (starting at 60 seconds) and starts a countdown
- First question is displayed with four multiple choice answers
- When incorrect choice is selected, 5 seconds is deducted from the total clock time
- When correct choice is selected, alert is presented, next question is also displayed

Unsuccessful:

- 2nd round of answers does not populate
- 3rd question and 3rd round of answers does not populate
- 4th question and 4th round of answers does not populate
- End of quiz prompt not completed
- Entry of initials is not completed

Although I feel like I gained some very beneficial experience in the project, I was not as successful as I had hoped, but still was proud of some of the work in the final result.
